* Wait forever for any elements under (and including) `document.body` to get `textContent` that contains `"blah"`.  Don't bother with node changes or attribute changes.  (This is waiting for text within the document to contain `"blah"`).

    ```
    matcher = new WaitForElements({
        selectors: [ "*" ],
        target: document.body,
        timeout: -1,
        filter: els => els.filter(el => el.textContent.includes("blah")),
        observerOptions: {
            subtree: true,
            characterData: true
        }
    });

    await matcher.match();
    ```

    It will resolve with a list of elements in document order from body down to every element with text containing `"blah"`.
